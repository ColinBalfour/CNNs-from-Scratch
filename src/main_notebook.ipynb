    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, at their core, function like any other mathematical function that can be evaluated. The process of evaluating a neural network is referred to as the forward pass. During this step, inputs are passed through the network layers, and outputs are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize the network's performance, its weights and biases need to be adjusted. This is done through a process called backward propagation (or backpropagation). In this step, the gradients of the loss function with respect to each parameter are calculated, and these gradients are subtracted from the corresponding weights and biases, allowing the network to learn and improve its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will dive into the implementation of custom layers in PyTorch. Specifically, you will focus on coding the forward pass and computing the gradients necessary for the backward pass. Before you begin, make sure to review the grading rubric to understand the criteria for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### CIFAR10 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "CIFAR-10 is a dataset consisting of 60000, 32Ã—32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. More details about the datset can be found [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample images from each class of the CIFAR-10 dataset is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![CIFAR 10](./artifacts/cifar10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will classify images into these 10 classes using the provided pipeline,loaders and helper classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you are expected to generate a confusion matrix to evaluate your model's performance. For guidance on plotting a confusion matrix in PyTorch, please refer to this [resource](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74020233/how-to-plot-confusion-matrix-in-pytorch).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Layer\n",
    "A linear layer in a neural network performs a linear transformation of the input data. It is defined by the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weights\n",
    "2. Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "More details below,\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pytorch Linear Layer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find information about the dimension of weights and biases in custom_layers.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soft Max\n",
    "The Softmax function is commonly used in neural networks for multi-class classification problems. It converts a vector of raw scores (logits) into probabilities, making it possible to interpret the output as the likelihood of each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sample implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34968722/how-to-implement-the-softmax-function-in-python)\n",
    "\n",
    "More details [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional layer is a fundamental building block in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used primarily for processing grid-like data such as images. It applies convolution operations to detect local features in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is called a convolutional layer, the PyTorch implementation of conv2d does not actually perform a convolution in the mathematical sense. Instead, it performs a cross-correlation operation, where the kernel is not flipped. This distinction is important to note, but for most deep learning projects including this one, cross-correlation is perfectly fine as the weights will automatically adjust during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, refer to [P0](https://rbe549.github.io/rbe474x/fall2024a/proj/p0/).\n"
